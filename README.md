Phasmophobia versus mod

-Credits to Kinetic Games for making such an awesome ghost game!

This is a simple mod for Phasmophobia that simulates a Versus gamemode-like experience where you can play as a ghost and hunt your friends(the ghost-hunters) and try not to be discovered

USE THIS MOD WITH YOUR FRIENDS IN A PRIVATE LOBBY, DO NOT RUIN THE GAME's EXPERIENCE FOR OTHERS.

Instructions:

Step 1:
-Install MelonLoader 0.4.2 to Phasmophobia, you can also use a newer version if you modify it to remove it's internal Phasmophobia checks. Here's a guide on how to do so: https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/phasmophobia/507237-remove-melonloaders-internal-anti-phasmophobia-measures.html (Credits to Crassmaker)

Step 2:
-Install a Bypass to the game's root directory, Phasmophobia has a simple AC that can detect mods and close the game. You need a bypass to prevent this.

Step 3:
-Create a "Mods" folder in the game's root directory

Step 4:
-Download the source code or the already build dll from UC, if you are downloading the SOURCE, you must have Visual Studio installed with C# and .NET to build it, you must also Do steps 5, 6, and 7 in first if you are building since you need references to the generated assemblies in the Melonloader/Managed folder

Step 5:
-Copy the PhasVersus mod to your "Mods" folder that you had created in step 3

Step 6:
-Install a Bypass injector mod, PhasVersus does not yet come with a bypass injector so you have to download or make your own, any normal manual map injector with an inject on auto detect function should also work

Step 7:
-Launch the game and wait

Step 8: (Optional)
-Join the Phasmophobia Modding Community on Discord! There are people who can help you (myself included! Wandering#6329) if you are having any issues with this or any other Phasmophobia mod in general https://discord.gg/mf3q7RX7v9
